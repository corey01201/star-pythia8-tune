Description:
	Measurements of the production of forward high energy $\pi^0$ mesons from transversely polarized proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200\ $GeV are reported. The cross section is generally consistent with next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations. The analyzing power is small at $x_F$ below about 0.3, and becomes positive and large at higher $x_F$, similar to the trend in data at $\sqrt{s}\le 20$ GeV. The analyzing power is in qualitative agreement with perturbative QCD model expectations. This is the first significant spin result seen for particles produced with $p_T > 1\ $GeV/c at a polarized proton collider.
